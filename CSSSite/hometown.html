We had two kind of farming, the one we used to go and buy food and take it to next village to sell, and the one we used to plant crops and other vegetables. My friends and I use to like planting crops, every Saturday morning we would go to each person house to wake them up with a bucket of cold water and then sing for them, that would make them stronger for early morning farming. </li>
