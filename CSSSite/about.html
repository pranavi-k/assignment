    <h2> About Myself</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif, sans-serif; line-height: 1.5;">
        My name is Justin Baker, and after five years of working in sales, I've decided to transition to a new occupation. While I still enjoy interacting with people and collaborating within a team, I'm eager to shift my focus to product management. My experience as a sales agent has given me valuable insights into what makes a product valuable and easy to sell, beyond just promotion and persuasiveness. Working "on the other side" has allowed me to appreciate the importance of marketing and development components. Recently, I've developed a keen interest in these fields. I believe that joining your team would be mutually beneficial. My expertise in sales can offer valuable insights and a fresh perspective on product development. Additionally, I'm excited about the opportunity to learn and grow in product launch and management. I'm committed to building a long-lasting collaboration.
